21: [x] got add sampleRole plus button to add new text field with different color

22: [x] tried to remove $scope.sampleRoles by 'delete' and 'splice'
        did not work.

23: [ ] delete one text field row in Roles page.  
        I have some alerts left from this session. 
        somehow page reloads the scope if its a link.
        if close object is <span> it remove all data but one...
